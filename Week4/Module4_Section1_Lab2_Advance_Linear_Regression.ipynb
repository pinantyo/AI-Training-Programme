Main limitation of Linear Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables. In the real world, the data is rarely linearly separable. It assumes that there is a straight-line relationship between the dependent and independent variables which is incorrect many times.\n","\n","2. Prone to noise and overfitting: If the number of observations are lesser than the number of features, Linear Regression should not be used, otherwise it may lead to overfit because is starts considering noise in this scenario while building the model.\n","\n","3. Prone to outliers: Linear regression is very sensitive to outliers (anomalies). So, outliers should be analyzed and removed before applying Linear Regression to the dataset.\n","\n","4.
